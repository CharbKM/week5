# Week 5 Homework

This week, you'll help fix a Rails app that your co-worker claimed is working, but in reality, it's not.

## Requirements

* Fork this repository into your account, then clone from your account as usual.
* Go to the homework/MoviesApp folder, and do whatever you must to be able to see the list of movies. (Hint: bundle install, rake db:migrate, etc...)

All seven action for the Movie resource should already be working. However, some actions for the Theater resource are buggy.

* Fix the code so that all seven actions for the Theater resource work properly.
* Eliminate all error messages, but also ensure that every action (add, edit, update, destroy, etc.) is managing the data properly.


## Remember these key ideas:

* Remember the RCAV recipe!
* Read error messages for clues!

## Bonus

There are a couple extra Rails goodies in this codebase.  For example:

* Can you figure out why every page has the same "NU Movie Database" header?
* Can you figure out how the maps are being displayed?

And here's a bonus challenge:

* Can you modify the app so that going to the root url, http://localhost:3000/, shows the list of movies instead of the Rails Welcome page?
